                                One of the things I learned from Maret is to be hungrier to learn and have confidence I can self-educate. Several times in the project there were new concepts (whether design, commerce, etc.), this never phased Maret, and each time she came back having done a tonne of research with concise informed conclusions.”

                                She has an incredible eye for detail and beauty and raises the bar of what people thought was possible. She balances this with a pragmatic approach to what is possible technically and from a budgetary perspective. Everyone in my company loved working with Maret.”
